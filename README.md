# Create an Infrastructure as Code Website from Scratch

## First steps

Yes, these could be done via Infrastructure as Code using a GitHub CLI, but I figured a gentle, familiar start was better than "pure" IaC.

* Create a github repo to hold this content. I used "create-an-infra-as-code-website-from-scratch" and the various examples here will use that name.
  * Repository name: "create-an-infra-as-code-website-from-scratch"
  * Description: "Example of creating a public website using Infrastructure as Code principles"
  * Add a README file: checked
  * No `.gitignore`
  * License: MIT License (for a very broad possibility of uses)
* Clone the site locally
  * If cloning a Git repo is unfamiliar, this [John Savill video on Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQJktcBzJUs) is a good place to start. Git skills are a must for working with Infrastructure as Code since your infrastructure will be described by code and Git manages code nicely.
* Update `README.md` in the `create-an-infra-as-code-website-from-scratch` directory with the contents of this file.
